            <p> Hello! I'm a 3rd year PhD student in EECS at MIT,
                co-advised by David Sontag in MIT CSAIL and Gaddy Getz at the Broad Institute.
                <br><br>
                Before starting my PhD, I went to Stern College of Yeshiva University for undergrad, where I majored
                in Physics and minored in Computer Science (and got an Associates Degree in Judaic studies!)
                and then studied Biomedical Engineering for my MS at Columbia Engineering.
                I also worked on the Molecular Profiling team at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for 2 years,
                which sparked my fascination with algorithms for genomic data.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    I am excited about our ability to use machine learning to better understand
    health and disease, especially in ways that can be impactful for patients.
    I focus on developing machine learning algorithms that can utilize clinical
    and genomic data for this purpose, with a particular focus on genomics and cancer.
